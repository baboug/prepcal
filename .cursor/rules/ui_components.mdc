# UI Components and Styling

## UI Framework
- Use Shadcn UI and Tailwind for components and styling
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS using a mobile-first approach
- Use `next/image` package for images
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use lucide-react for icons and import them with Icon as the suffix e.g. `CheckIcon`
