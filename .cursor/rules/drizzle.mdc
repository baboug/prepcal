# Drizzle Usage

We use PostgreSQL.

This is how we import drizzle in the project:

```typescript
import { db } from "@/lib/db";
```

The database table schemas are located in the folder at: `@/lib/db/schema.ts`.

Always fetch data using the select method:
```typescript
const result = await db.select().from(user);
```
